## This is coursera programming assignment â„–2
## There are 2 functions for caching and inversing matrix

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        cache <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                cache <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setinv <- function(solve) m <<- inv
        getinv <- function() m
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setinv = setinv,
             getinv = getinv)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should 
## retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
